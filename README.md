[0x][website-url] is an open protocol that facilitates trustless, low friction exchange of Ethereum-based assets. For more information on how it works, check out the [0x protocol specification](https://protocol.0x.org/).

This repository is a monorepo including the 0x protocol smart contracts and numerous developer tools. Each public sub-package is independently published to NPM.

## Usage

Node version 6.x or 8.x is required.

Most of the packages require additional typings for external dependencies.
You can include those by prepending the `@0x/typescript-typings` package to your [`typeRoots`](http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html) config.

```json
"typeRoots": ["node_modules/@0x/typescript-typings/types", "node_modules/@types"],
```
