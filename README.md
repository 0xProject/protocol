## Introduction

The 0x API is a collection of services and endpoints that can be run together or separately. In aggregate, the APIs provide interfaces to 0x liquidity.
Everything can be run monolithically via `yarn start` and `docker-compose` up as described in [Getting Started](#getting-started).

## Services

The API contains different services that serve a collection of HTTP or websocket endpoints and keep your order states in sync with the Ethereum state.

### HTTP Services

These are services that handle HTTP requests and responses.

| Name                                                | Path                | Run Command                                | Requires Ethereum JSON RPC Provider? | Requires Relational Database? |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| All HTTP Services                                   | `/*`                | `yarn start:service:http`                  | Yes                                  | Yes                           |
| [Swap](https://0x.org/docs/api#swap)                | `/swap`             | `yarn start:service:swap_http`             | Yes                                  | Yes                           |
| [Standard Relayer API](https://0x.org/docs/api#sra) | `/sra`              | `yarn start:service:sra_http`              | No                                   | Yes                           |
| Meta Transaction Service                            | `/meta_transaction` | `yarn start:service:meta_transaction_http` | Yes                                  | Yes                           |

### Data Services

The transaction watcher ensures that the data being served is present and up-to-date by keeping the database in sync with Ethereum. The endpoints above run without it, but would be providing degraded or non-functional service.

| Name                                                          | Run Command                              | Requires Ethereum JSON RPC Provider? | Requires Relational Database? |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Transaction Watcher (monitor and broadcast meta transactions) | `yarn start:service:transaction_watcher` | Yes                                  | Yes                           |

## Getting started

#### Pre-requirements

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) > v8.x
-   [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) > v1.x
-   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) > 19.x

#### Developing

To get a local development version of `0x-api` running:

1. Clone the repo.

2. Create an `.env` file and copy the content from the `.env_example` file. Defaults are defined in `config.ts`/`config.js`. The bash environment takes precedence over the `.env` file. If you run `source .env`, changes to the `.env` file will have no effect until you unset the colliding variables.

| Environment Variable                   | Default                                                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                            |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CHAIN_ID`                             | Required. No default.                                           | The chain id you'd like your API to run on (e.g: `1` -> mainnet, `42` -> Kovan, `3` -> Ropsten, `1337` -> Ganache). Defaults to `42` in the API, but required for `docker-compose up`. |

| `POSTGRES_URI`                         | Required. Default for dev: `postgresql://api:api@localhost/api` | A URI of a running postgres instance. By default, the API will create all necessary tables. A default instance is spun up in `docker-compose up`                                       |
| `POSTGRES_READ_REPLICA_URIS`           | Optional. No default                                            | A comma separated list of URIs of running postgres read replica instances.                                                                                                             |

3. Install the dependencies:

    ```sh
    yarn
    ```

4. Build the project:

    ```sh
    yarn build
    ```

5. Run `docker-compose up` to run the other dependencies required for the API. This uses the local `docker-compose.yml` file.

6. Run the database migrations:

```
yarn db:migrate
```

7. Start the API

    ```sh
    yarn start
    ```

    For development:

    ```sh
    yarn dev
    ```

#### Developing on Ganache

To use ganache, use the `.env` file below:

```
CHAIN_ID=1337
ETHEREUM_RPC_URL=http://ganache:8545
```

Then run

```
$ docker-compose up
$ yarn dev
```

## Testing

Run `yarn test`. It's really that easy :)

Tip: Test suites set up and teardown sandboxed environments, so using `.only` on `it` and `describe` statements will save lots of development time.

## Commands

-   `yarn build` - Build the code
-   `yarn test` - Test the code
-   `yarn lint` - Lint the code
-   `yarn start` - Starts the API
-   `yarn dev` - Starts the API in dev-mode
-   `yarn watch` - Watch the source code and rebuild on change
-   `yarn prettier` - Auto-format the code
-   `yarn release` - Release a new version of the 0x-api

## Deployment

A Docker image is built and hosted by [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/0xorg/0x-api) every time a change to the `master` branch occurs. A Docker image is built, pushed and [tagged](https://hub.docker.com/r/0xorg/0x-api/tags) when a new version is [released](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-api/releases) as well.
Running this image will run 0x API as a monolith, with all its dependencies. You can run any of the [services](#services) separately by [overriding the Docker command](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#cmd-default-command-or-options) with the service-specific command when running the container.

When versioning the API, we freeze the old version in a separate branch so that we can deploy patches, and continue to support the old version until it's officially deprecated. **Be aware when contributing fixes that you may want to apply the fix to an older version too.**

This is a list of endpoints supported by different versions of the API. If an endpoint is not on this list, it is by default pointed to the master branch.

| Endpoint(s)                         | API version branch                                      | @0x/asset-swapper branch                                       |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/swap/v0/`, `/meta_transaction/v0` | https://github.com/0xProject/0x-api/tree/freeze/swap-v0 | https://github.com/0xProject/0x-monorepo/tree/v0-asset-swapper |
| `/sra/v3`                           | https://github.com/0xProject/0x-api/tree/freeze/sra-v3  | N/A                                                            |

## Release

Releases are triggered automatically by the [release GitHub action](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-api/actions?query=workflow%3ARelease).
They can also be triggered manually by using `yarn release`, which requires a [GITHUB_TOKEN](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) environment variable.

## Database

This project uses [TypeORM](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm). It makes it easier for anyone to switch out the backing database used by this project. By default, this project uses a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database.

To add a migration, you may use the following command:

```
yarn db:migration:create -n myMigration
```
