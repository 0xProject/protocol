Allowances
###############################

Both maker and taker allowance should be be set directly on the `Exchange Proxy contract <./addresses.html#exchange-v4>`_.

For takers, legacy allowances set on the `Allowance Target <./addresses.html#exchange-v4>`_ will continue to work during this transition period but will suffer a gas penalty. It's highly encouraged to migrate allowances over to the Exchange Proxy as soon as possible to avoid interruption.
