Governance
###############################

.. note::
    The 0x Community uses their ZRX (and staked ZRX) tokens to govern the protocol, by voting on proposals called `ZEIPs <https://github.com/0xProject/ZEIPs>`_. Anyone can propose a change to the system by creating a ZEIP. Visit `https://0x.org/zrx/vote <https://0x.org/zrx/vote>`_ to participate!

Introduction
============

Since launching in 2017, the the 0x Protocol has progressively
decentralized control from the founding team ‚Äì its initial stewards ‚Äì to
an ecosystem of incentive-aligned contributors and participants ‚Äì its
community. Our goal is to become a fully accountable community that is
directly responsible for the protocol‚Äôs long-term sustenance, and our
decentralization roadmap lays out the path. 

Every token holder, big or small, can play a role in governance ‚Äì from
weighing in on ZeroEx Improvement Proposals (ZEIPs), to sharing ideas on
how to use DAO treasury funds, to actively contributing to the
protocol‚Äôs advancement in a myriad of other ways. Over time, we expect
that projects using 0x technology in their products and services will
become more active in governance, as they depend on the credibly neutral
and reliable decentralized exchange infrastructure that the protocol
provides. 

Governance Participants
=======================

The 0x DAO is a community of informed people with skin in the game: ZRX
owners, marketmakers, delegates, and other interested parties whose
incentives are aligned with the good functioning of the protocol,
including an ever-growing network of ecosystem partners using 0x
technology in their products and services. 

By participating in 0x governance, you can suggest ways to put communal
funds to work, explore opportunities for the protocol to drive value
creation and capture, and vote on key protocol upgrades and parameters. 

Over time, participating in the act of governance enables stewards to
build reputations worthy of delegation and trust; helps to surface and
galvanize ideas that would otherwise remain hidden or abstract and
unable to be acted on; and also strengthens community bonds that
reinforce longevity and resilience.

Types of Votes
==============

ZRX token holders can participate in 0x governance by joining the
conversations in the `0x forum <https://gov.0x.org/>`__ and
participating in on- and off-chain votes in the `ZRX
portal <https://0x.org/zrx/vote>`__. There are currently three types of
votes:

+----------------+----------------------------------+------------+-----+

Community Treasury
==================

In the Spring of 2021, the `community
treasury <https://0x.org/zrx/treasury>`__ was established with initial
seed-funding from 0x Labs. Since then, the Polygon and Celo networks
have also made contributions. 

The purpose of the community treasury is not enforced, and ZRX holders
are in control of what to do with the funds. The suggested usage,
however, is the funding of projects that benefit the 0x ecosystem and
provide positive effects to ZRX holders.

How to Delegate ZRX
===================

To be eligible to vote on a ZEIP or treasury proposal, your ZRX must be
staked or delegated. You can delegate to yourself, a staking pool
operator, or an existing delegate by doing the following:

1. Go to https://0x.org/zrx/vote and connect your wallet 
2. Click on the green button that says Register your ZRX
3. Choose the Register path by clicking on the green button that says
   Register your ZRX
4. To delegate to yourself, click the green button that says Confirm
   Registration
5. To delegate to someone else, click where it says Delegate to someone
   else and then choose from the available options and click the green
   button that says Choose this new pool
6. Completing step 4 or 5 will require you to approve a transaction in
   your wallet, which will require a small amount of ETH for gas
