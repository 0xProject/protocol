# 0x-API Generated Artifacts

Both `src/generated-artifacts` and `src/generated-wrappers` are generated from the
0x API `build` script using the logic that used to live in `@0x/asset-swapper`.

// TODO (rhinodavid): Once repos are merged, change this to a dependency on the asset swapper package

These files were generated at `0x-api` commit `e16f0c61a7822844d2f5becaa7f78ffb978fb26c`.

Note that the files expect `ethers` at version 4.0.49.
