 * This migration was originally used to populate `rfq_maker_pairs` table as we move pairs info from
 * config files to DB. But the code logic does not work any more as we move more maker config info,
 * such as rfqmUri and rfqtUri, to DB.
 * So we removed the migration logic but keep the migration file as a placeholder as the original code
